\begin_layout Abstract
This paper will analyze the behviour of different equations as possible
 models for credit card debt.
 Four different equations will be considered.
 The first two equations will be used to compare the accuracy of a discrete
 time model of debt where intrest is calculated a certain number of time
 each year against a continous model in which the debt is calculated an
 infinite number of times each year.
 These two models will be compared at various intrest rates.
 The final two models are differential equations, one of which defines the
 continous model and one which describes an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

installment debt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model in which an account holder pays a set amount of debt off each year.
 These models will be considered for their properties and how long it will
 take to pay off a set debt.
 Finally an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

installment savings
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model will be created based on the reviewed models and then analyzed in
 the context of the observed properties of the previous models under considerati
on.

\begin_layout Standard
The second model being reviewed in this paper is a continous model for a

 number of times in a time interval (one year in this case).
 The model is the below model

 term for the number of times per year that the intrest is applied to the
 account is missing as this model applies intrest an infinite number of
 times every year.

Classification of model 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model4"

\end_inset

 is a first order equation as the highest derivative is the second derivative,
 but it is not homogenous and there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $-P$
\end_inset

 term that comes from the amount being paid by the account holder each year.
 This model is autonomous as time does not affect the derivative, only the
 y-value has an effect.
 All of the terms in model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model4"

\end_inset

 have constant coefficients as 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is unchanging and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is unchanging.
 Nothing else can be said to classify model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model4"

\end_inset

 as it is non-homogenous.

Comparison of Discrete model as compounding rate increases

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compare model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model1"

\end_inset

 to model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model2"

\end_inset

 it is useful to consider the behaviour of model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model1"

\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 (the rate at which intrest is calculated) is increased to infinity such
 that model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model1"

\end_inset

 should become model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model2"

\end_inset

.
 The below calculations were performed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $A_{d}(t)=A_{o}(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$
\end_inset

 ts taken to the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}A_{o}(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$
\end_inset

 it becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{o}lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$
\end_inset

 so that we can then define 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{n}{r}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $u\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 so that we can then write 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{o}lim_{u\rightarrow\infty}(1+\frac{1}{u})^{urt}$
\end_inset

 and by definition 
\begin_inset Formula $lim_{u\rightarrow\infty}(1+\frac{1}{u})^{u}=e$
\end_inset

 so the overall equation becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{o}e^{rt}$
\end_inset

 which is model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model2"

\end_inset

 as originally expected, thus proving that when 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model1"

\end_inset

 becomes model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:model2"

\end_inset

.

Model 1 and 2 Solved for time

\begin_layout Standard
Using algebra with model 1 results in the below equation for t:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t=ln(\frac{\frac{A}{A_{o}}}{nln(\frac{r}{n}+1)})
\]

\end_inset

Using algebra with mode 2 results in the below equation for t:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t=\frac{ln(\frac{A}{A_{o}})}{r}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These equations can be easily be reproduced by manipulating the model equations
 given in this paper.
 These solutions allow a debtor to calculate how long it will take for their
 debt to become a certain value based on the intrest rate, initial debt,
 and for model 1 the rate at which that debt is calculated.

 the difference between the two models was investigated using a variety
 of different conditions.
 In the below plots of the continous and discrete models' behavior over
 100 years the account was assumed to have initial account balance of $1,
 an intrest rate of 10% and 20%, with the assumption that the discrete model
 only had intrest applied each year.

In the above figure 2 we can see very clearly that the difference between
 the continous and discrete models is significantly greater when the intrest
 rate is increased to 20%.
 Based on the plot above it can be seen that when the discrete model is
 calculated each year it does not match the continous model, as should be
 expected as the continous model by definition will result in a greater
 account balance as it calculates intrest more frequently.
 This behavior matches the plots that have been created, thus validating
 the results in figures 1 and 2.

When reviewing the above plots we can see that the difference between the
 discrete and continous model increases when the intrest rate increases
 and when the discrete models compounding rate decreases.
 As such we can say that model 2 most accurately approximates model 1 when
 model 1 has a compounding rate that is large (in this case daily) and the
 intrest rate is relatively low.
 As such we can conclude that model 2 is an accurate approximation for the
 values showcased in this section.

As can be clearly seen the pattern observed in section 2 still holds as
 the time it takes for the two models to differ y more than a dollar decreases
 as the intrest rate increases.
 These results support the findings showcased in the above figures and the

Equilibrium Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper's examination of model 4 begins by considering its equilibrium
 solution.
 Based on the given model we can conclude that the equilibrium solution
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p}{r}=A_{c}$
\end_inset

, as this is the only place for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dA_{c}}{dt}$
\end_inset

 is exactly zero for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This equilibrium solution is the point at which the account holder has
 enough debt that their rate of monthly payment exactly equals their intrest
 rate.
 This equilibrium solution is unstable as a value either slightly above
 or slightly below this value will result in exponentially increasing debt
 or exponentially decreasing debt respectively.
 As such they will be stuck with a static amount of debt as they will only
 every be paying off the intrest on the account.

Derivative Behavior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to better understand the behavior of model 4 the rate of change
 of the account balance was plotted against the account balance with the
 assumption that the account had an intrest rate of 10% and the account
 holder paid $20 a year against the account.
 The resulting figure 11 is shown below.

As we can clearly see in the above figure 11 when the account has a balance
 of $200 the account balance is unchanging in time as the rate of payment
 ($20) is exactly equal to the intrest charged against the account.
 When the account balance is less than $200 the account balance (debt) is
 decreasing (
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dA_{c}}{dt}<0$
\end_inset

) as the rate of payment is greater than the intrest being charged to the
 account.
 When the account balance is greater than $200 the account balance (debt)
 is increasing(

In figure 12 above the arrows of the direction field represent the slope
 of the differential equation at that point.
 In this case it shows the rate at which the account holder's balance is
 increasing or decreasing as a result of the intrest charged and the payments
 made.
 When the arrows point downwards they indicate a negative slope, which means
 that solution cuves that move through fields with downwards arrows will
 move towards zero as the debt held by the account holder is decreasing
 until it vanishes.
 When the arrows point upwards they indicate a positive slope, which means
 that solution cuves that move through fields with upwards arrows will move
 towards infinity as the debt held by the account holder is constantly increasin
g.
 The plot exhibits asymptotic behavior when the slope is positive or negative
 as the exponential nature of the solution curves forces the account balance
 to near infinite values in a finite time when the slope is positive and
 forces the account balance to zero quickly when the slope is negative.
 When the account balance is exactly $200 for the conditions described the
 equilibrium conditions are met and the slope is zero for all time.

Initial Value Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step in this analysis was to solve the differential equation in
 model 4.
 Using an integrating factor allowed the differential equation to be solved
 which resulted in the below equation where 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is some constant:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{c}(t)=\frac{P-Ce^{rt}}{r}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step in analyzing this equation is to solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 which was accomplished by assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{c}(0)=A_{o}$
\end_inset

 which meant that 
\begin_inset Formula $C=P-A_{o}r$
\end_inset

.
 When substituted back into the found equation the resulting solution to
 the differential equation in mode 4 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{c}(t)=\frac{P-(P-A_{o}r)e^{rt}}{r}

Time to pay off debt at rate of payment

\begin_layout Standard
In order to better understand how model 4 be analyzed to best determine
 how to pay off debt in the best way.
 In order to best consider the behavior of the time it takes to pay off
 the debt as compared to the amount payed the equation that solves model
 4 was solved for time.
 Simple algera resulted in the below equation:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t=\frac{ln(\frac{P-rA}{P-rA_{o}})}{r}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was then assumed that the account holder wanted to maintain a debt of
 $2 dollars on an account that originally had $1 in it and their account
 has an intrest rate of 10%.
 Under these conditions the resulting time values were plotted for differing
 values of payment.

\begin_layout Standard
As we can see in the above figure 13 for payments between zero and $1 it
 takes less and less time for the balance to reach the $2 amount.
 Once the rate of payment reaches some value close to $1 the time value
 becomes negative because at that point the rate of payment is larger than
 the rate at which intrest is being added, which means that the only time
 the account could have had a balance of $2 was in the past as the debt
 is decreasing.
 As the payments increase however this low value of the time increases from
 approximatly 1 year in the past as the greater payments mean that the time
 when the account balance was $2 for the initial condition of $1 happened
 closer to the intial condition as the payment is greater and as such a
 smaller amount of time has passed since the point in the past the account
 balance was $2 and the present when the account balance is $1.
 As such we can see when the account balance will reach some point given
 and initial condition, the intrest rate, and then find a workable payment
 so settle the debt to that value in a set amount of time.

In order to better understand how model 4 be analyzed to best determine
 how to pay off debt in the best way.
 In order to best consider the behavior of how long it will take to pay
 off the time it takes to pay off the debt as compared to the amount payed
 the equation that solves model 4 was solved for time.
 Simple algera resulted in the below equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\frac{-r(A-A_{o}e^{rt})}{e^{rt}}-1
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This formula is useful because it allows the account holder to discover
 how much they will have to pay each period in order to pay off their debt
 in a set time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was then assumed that the account holder originally had $1 in their account
 and that account has an intrest rate of 100%.
 Under these conditions the resulting payment values were plotted for differing
 values of time.

As can be seen in the above figure 14 when the goal is to reach the desired
 payment in a short amount of time (1-3 years) Then the payment slowly increases
 as you need a larger payment to counteract the intrest being generated
 to force the account balance to the desired value.
 However, as the time increases the value of the payment increases towards
 1 because once the payment becomes 1 the intrest rate will exactly cancel
 the payments and the account balance will remain constant.
 As such this plot shows the trends in the payment needed to maintain an
 existing balance with an initial account condition of $1.

Accuracy of Installment Debt Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the analysis conducted in the above sections it can be concluded
 that model 4 is a reasonable model for installment debt.
 This is true because model 4 exhibits the behavior we would expect of installme
nt debt as it shows exponential debt increase when payments are less than
 the intrest on the account and exponential debt decrease when payments
 are more than the intrest on the account.
 All other patterns such as the behavior of the solution curve occurs as
 we would expect an installment debt model to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this model is severly flawed as it assumes that the account holder
 will not use the credit card.
 This is a severe limitation as most credit card holders will not incur
 an initial value of debt on the card and then not use that card while paying
 a set amount over a long period of time.
 As such this model does not help understand the behavior of the average
 credit card user.
 There is another large limitation of model 4 in that it assumes that the
 account holder will pay a set amount of the debt off every pay period.
 As such this model does not take into account a account holder that changes
 the amount they pay each month.

Installment Savings

\begin_layout Standard
In order to better understand the basic principles of models similar to
 the installment debt model this paper will now consider an installment
 savings model.
 Based on the installment debt model a model for the value of a savings
 account with constant payments being made to it is the below model 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin{equation}
\frac{dA_{s}}{dt}=rA_{s}+P\label{eq:model4-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above model 5 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the balance of the account, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the annual intrest rate (some value such that 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq r\leq1$
\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the time in years since the account was created, 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the amount deposited in the account each year, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dA_{s}}{dt}$
\end_inset

 is rate of change of the balance of the account.
 This model exhibits all the behaviors we expect of the installment model
 as it adds the additional deposits to the account balance while also adding
 the intrest generated from the bank.
